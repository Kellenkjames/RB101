# What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to answer.

def meal
  return 'Breakfast'
end

puts meal 

# Answer: Breakfast

# Reason: When return is executed, it immediately exits the method, returning the provided value. 

# Note: The code in this particular exercise would return the string 'Breakfast' with or without the 'return' on line 4 because  is the last (and only) line executed in the meal method.
