# Modify the following code so that double-quotes are used instead of single-quotes.

puts 'It\'s now 12 o\'clock.' # when using single quotes around our string, we need to escape using single quotes

puts "It's now 12 o'clock."

# Note: According to the Ruby style guide it's preferred that we use double quotes around our string when we need to have single quotes within it.
