# Using the following code, capitalize the value of state then print the modified value. Note that state should have the modified value both before and after you print it.

state = 'tExAs' 

state.capitalize!
puts state # Texas 

# Note: We use the destructive version of String#capitalize to satisfy the requirement that "state" is actually modified.
