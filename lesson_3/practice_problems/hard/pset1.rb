#* Practice Problems: Hard 1

# Question 1: What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?

if false
  greeting = "hello world"
end

p greeting  # nil 

# Solution: greeting is 'nil' here, and no "undefined method or local variable" exception is thrown. Typically, when you reference an uninitialized variable, Ruby will raise an exception, stating that it's undefined. 

# However, when you initialize a local variable within an if block, even if that if block doesnâ€™t get executed, the local variable is initialized to nil.

puts # ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 2: What is the result of the last line in the code below? 

greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings # { :a=> "hi there" }

# Solution: The output is { :a=>"hi there" }. The reason is because informal_greeting is a reference to the original object. The line informal_greeting << ' there' was using the String#<< method, which modifies the object that called it. 

# This means that the original object was changed, thereby impacting the value in greetings. If instead of modifying the original object, we wanted to only modify informal_greeting but not greetings, there are a couple of options:

# 1. informal_greeting = greetings[:a].clone => reference to a new object 

#2. informal_greeting = informal_greeting + ' there'  => returns a new string object 

puts # ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 3: In other practice problems, we have looked at how the scope of variables affects the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

# To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification of one scope by another, consider the following similar sets of code.

# What will be printed by each of these code groups?

# A) 
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two # => doesn't mutate the object referenced by that variable; instead, binds to a new obj
  two = three # => doesn't mutate the object referenced by that variable; instead, binds to a new obj
  three = one 
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}" # "one"
puts "two is: #{two}" # "two"
puts "three is: #{three}" # "three"
